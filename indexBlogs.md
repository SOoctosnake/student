### August 17th 2023
I installed WSL and vscode. This will help me make a website on github

####  1) WSL is a type of virtual machine inbuit in Windows to run linux.

a. To properly install WSL, I opened the command prompt as adminstrater. This is where we will be doing a lot of the installations

b. To install WSL, I used the command: **wsl --install** 

c. After WSL installation, I ran this command to install Ubuntu from WSL: **wsl --install -d Ubuntu**

#### 2) Now I installed vscode. It is good to have all the files of a repository on github but if I wanted to actually make a website and edit it, I would need to use vscode

a) I first downloaded VScode here: [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

b) Then install I it. I clicked on add the Remote Developers extension pack (forgot to do it before) and I clicked Add to PATH

Now I have VS code and WSL working!
